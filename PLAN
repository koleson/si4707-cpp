bugs:
- number of messages needed to get message seems to be off-by-one for 60 char messages

short-term:
- clear SAME message buffer and interrupts
- include confidence data in MQTT output

long-term:
- si4707:  allocate SAME buffers based on MSGLEN
- add DNS lookup of hostname
- emit MQTT of SAME state on SAME state changes rather than fixed interval
  - need to store and have convenience comparison of SAME state
